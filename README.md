## Overview
The Media Exchange Layer (MXL) is a high-performance data plane designed to simplify and accelerate communication between distributed media functions. The MXL enables entirely new production paradigms, including asynchronous “faster-than-live” workflows, allowing teams to produce content more flexibly and quickly than traditional linear models permit. Moreover, its extensible design supports evolving transport mechanisms and new media formats as they emerge, ensuring that the architecture is well equipped to evolve alongside technological progress.

To encourage broad industry adoption, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the North American Broadcasters Association (NABA), and the Linux Foundation are pursuing an “implement-first” strategy. This practical, hands-on approach involves close collaboration with broadcasters and technology suppliers to produce an open-source software development kit that promotes interoperability and showcases real-world use cases for the MXL. The first version of this SDK was released in June 2025.
